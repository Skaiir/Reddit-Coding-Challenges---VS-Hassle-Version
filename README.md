# Reddit (/r/dailyprogrammer) coding challenges. #
I've decided to put some of my coding/scripting up here, for those interested.

## Some of the more interesting scripts ##
While that's not true yet, I expect this repository to get pretty large over time. 
So I've decided that I'd reference some of the more interesting stuff here.

* Day3 - Hard - TextUnscramble {Decoding scrambled words from a word list}
* Day4 - Medium - MathParser {Taking a string mathematical set of operation (ie: "1+5*6/5-22+4") and outputing its result}
* Day7 - Easy - MorseCodeTranslate {Self explanatory}
* Day7 - Medium - RecursiveDrawingProject {Attempt at a winform based recursive drawing app}


*If you would like a list of all the challenges + their completion status, read index.md (TODO)*

*To run the scripts, you can either download the entire repo and change program.cs to select the correct script (they are all called through the Run() function), or download a script and change Run() to Main().*
